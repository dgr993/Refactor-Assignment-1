Refactor Website

I scrubbed the html and css to make the flow more logical. I replaced most of the div markers to be able to understand what each part of the website was specifically for. I add indentation to the css to show sub elements of the parent more clearly. I also removed alot of classes to better build a framework that is more customizable for future edits.
